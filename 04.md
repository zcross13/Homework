 2. node.js aka server.js listens for the request and send it to express 
 3. express aka route controller identify what kind request it is and send to the view controller (jsx) or data controller (mongoose). 
4. when the view controller is select it renders a template 
5. when mongoose is selected it retrieve data from mongoose. 
6. both the view and data controller send the response back to express which send the requested information to the user.
